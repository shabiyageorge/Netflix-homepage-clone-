As part of my journey to learn web development, I undertook a project to create a basic Netflix clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, specifically in building responsive web applications that fetch data from external sources using APIs. By integrating the TMDB (The Movie Database) API and the YouTube Search API, I built a simple yet functional clone that displays a collection of movies and TV shows, allowing users to search for specific titles and view trailers.
